## 🧠 Use Cases Implemented
| # | Use Case | Description | Model Used |
|---|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| 1️⃣ | **Customer Sentiment Analysis** | Analyzed social media posts to classify customer opinions on digital banking as positive, negative, or neutral. | Logistic Regression |
| 2️⃣ | **Fraud Detection** | Detected fraudulent banking transactions using transaction data. | Logistic Regression, Random Forest |
| 3️⃣ | **Loan Default Prediction** | Predicted which customers are likely to default on loans. | Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosted Trees |
| 4️⃣ | **Customer Segmentation** | Clustered customers for personalized offers using transaction and demographic data. | K-Means Clustering |
| 5️⃣ | **Real-Time Credit Risk Monitoring** | Monitored live customer data to flag high-risk profiles instantly. | Gradient Boosted Trees |
